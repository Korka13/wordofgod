## The story

I was waiting the underground train in my city, and on the wall was written this small text: ```www.wordofgod.gr```.  
Well, this kind of "propaganda" thrilled me, so I took the phone out of my poket and typed the address in my browser to check what was there.  
The totally unresponsivness of the website, and probably a missing redirect to the right intended page, made me seeing the website's navbar and footer, but without any content at all.  
I said **Wow, this genius made the "Word of God" website, without anything in it!!!**  
After a while I was quite disappointed to find out that was just very badly constructed, and the content was there.  
So I came out with **www.wordofgod.gq** to start my "propaganda" in my city's undergrounds.

If you made it until here you'll probably visit also the site; bear in mind that "**Nulla**" in Italian means "**Nothing**", in a more deep way  

PS: I'm just having fun, I don't have anything against anything or anyone, don't be offended by this small joke
